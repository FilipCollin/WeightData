# WeightData

This is an assignment for the course I am studying.
This module is still in development so all features may not be smooth or just useless. 
The WeightData module allows you to keep track of your weight goal. This is my first time ever doing functions and a module. 
Since im new to powershell and this is my first time doing something like this it may contain some bugs that im not aware of but trying my best to find and fix them.
